# Data setup instructions

Go to the Canvas `Files > HW4` folder and download `cats.zip` and `mnist.zip`:
[https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/217080/files/folder/HW4](
https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/217080/files/folder/HW4). You can also use
`cats.tgz` and `mnist.tgz` if you don't want to install `zip`.

After you decompress those files (e.g., `unzip cats.zip` or `tar xzf
cats.tgz`), make sure this `data/` folder has two subfolders, `cats/` and
`mnist`, and each of those subfolders has 16 images named `0.png` to `15.png`.
